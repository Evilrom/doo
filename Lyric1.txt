We're all this purity.
Evolving through the unknown.
shinning dark beams of light,
witnesses of our essence

The vicinity snaps dem up
No matter how hard we try
Noisy misconception
deadly unavoidable

Destination was clear
Masses made it blurry
It costs for that bubble
to prone integrity

Just set us free an instant
and let's surf on the curve of the time
telling each other what we'd love to hear
from another lost particle

Opening the eyes, 
Right Into the abyss, 
Changing to a light, 
Escaping to gravity, 

Through the circles and spheres, 
Reaching a new dimension, 
From one to other lightyear, 
Through the cyclic attraction, 

A wave(ray ?) of energy,
A simple frequency, 
Drown into the light, 
Of the ancient nebula
