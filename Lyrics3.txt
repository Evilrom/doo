Vaporous auroras sliding on the lines,
Vanishing in the night as well as our minds,
Which once tried to follow the most obscure signs,
Of that gleam dancing around over the pines.

Should you trust the luminous tale :
lies in the dark, truth in the pale.
Leave yourself travel through the vale
and face the reality gale.

Embrace the experience of it all.
Abandon your soul to its attraction
then soon you'll hear the echoing call.
And avoid any misconception.

--- Plus tard, plus dans le délire voyage dans l'univers.

Pure insanity burnished by years of drifting
In eternal and intimidating darkness
Stars still linger, intense sacred light-emetting
Reflecting in every corner of the universe.

Cyclical pikes of powerful energy
flow through your head with strong synergy.
Feel the modulations of its activity
undeniably telling you a secret story,
making our old great universe's apology
and let you know about your ancestry.
